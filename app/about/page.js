          The truth is, template websites can be set up easily, but they often
          underperform. They're slow, clunky, and difficult to optimize for
          search engines. This costs you leads, sales, and valuable brand
          authority.

          But we get it. Spending thousands of dollars upfront on a website
          isn't always feasible for all businesses. At best, you get a
          cookie-cutter website that can't stand out from your competitors. And
          at worst, you get a website that's slow, doesn't work well on mobile
          and actually loses you revenue.
